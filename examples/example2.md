  ⎿ Of course. Here is a detailed requirements plan for a production-ready systematic algorithmic trading backend.
    ### **Requirements Plan: Systematic Algorithmic Trading Backend**
    This document outlines the requirements for a robust, scalable, and resilient backend system for systematic
    algorithmic trading. The system is designed for production use, emphasizing stability, performance, and
    comprehensive risk management.
    ---
    #### **1. System Architecture**
    The system will be built on a **microservices architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and
    independent deployment of components. Communication between services will primarily use a high-throughput,
    low-latency **message queue** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous event-driven workflows, supplemented by
     REST/gRPC APIs for synchronous requests.
    **Core Services:**
    *   **Data Ingestor Service:** Connects to various market data sources (vendors, exchanges) and normalizes the
     data into a canonical format.
    *   **Strategy Engine Service:** Hosts and executes trading strategies. It subscribes to data streams,
    processes logic, and generates trading signals.
    *   **Order Management Service (OMS):** Translates signals into executable orders, manages the order
    lifecycle, and communicates with broker APIs.
    *   **Risk Management Service:** A central service that performs pre-trade and post-trade risk checks on all
    trading activities.
    *   **Portfolio Service:** Maintains the real-time state of all positions, cash, and buying power.
    *   **Backtesting Service:** An offline environment that simulates strategy execution against historical data
    with high fidelity.
    *   **Monitoring & Alerting Service:** Tracks system health, performance metrics, and trading PnL, issuing
    alerts when anomalies are detected.
    **Technology Stack (Proposed):**
    *   **Primary Language:** Python (for its rich data science and trading ecosystem like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
    and/or Go/Rust (for performance-critical components).
    *   **Message Queue:** Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
    *   **Database:**
        *   **Time-Series DB:** InfluxDB or TimescaleDB for market data.
        *   **Relational DB:** PostgreSQL for static data (strategy configs, user data, trade history).
        *   **In-Memory DB:** Redis for caching and real-time state management.
    *   **Containerization:** Docker & Kubernetes for deployment, scaling, and orchestration.
    ---
    #### **2. Data Management**
    The system must handle the ingestion, storage, and retrieval of large volumes of financial data efficiently
    and reliably.
    *   **Data Sources:**
        *   Connectors for at least two distinct data vendors (e.g., Polygon.io, Alpaca, IEX Cloud) and/or direct
    exchange feeds (e.g., ITCH/OUCH protocols).
        *   Support for different data types: real-time tick data, bar data (time, volume, dollar), fundamental
    data, and alternative data (e.g., news sentiment).
    *   **Data Normalization & Storage:**
        *   All incoming data must be transformed into a unified, canonical format before being published to the
    message queue.
        *   Market data must be stored in a time-series database, indexed by symbol and timestamp for rapid
    retrieval.
        *   A data integrity module must be implemented to detect and handle common issues like data gaps,
    corrupted ticks, and stock splits/dividends.
    *   **Data Access:**
        *   Provide a simple, high-performance API for both the live Strategy Engine and the Backtesting Service
    to query historical data.
    ---
    #### **3. Strategy Development & Execution**
    The core of the system, focused on providing a secure and efficient environment for running trading
    algorithms.
    *   **Strategy SDK:**
        *   A framework/SDK in Python that allows developers to define strategies easily. It should abstract away
    the complexities of data handling and order execution.
        *   Strategies should be defined as classes with methods like `on_bar(data)`, `on_tick(data)`, and
    `on_order_update(update)`.
    *   **Strategy Engine:**
        *   The engine must be capable of running multiple strategies concurrently, each in its own isolated
    process or container.
        *   It subscribes to relevant data streams from the message queue.
        *   Upon generating a signal (e.g., `BUY 100 AAPL`), it publishes the signal to the message queue for the
    OMS to process.
    *   **Backtesting Environment:**
        *   A high-fidelity backtester that simulates the live environment as closely as possible.
        *   Must accurately model latency, transaction costs (commissions, fees), and market impact (slippage).
        *   Crucially, it must be architected to prevent **lookahead bias**.
        *   Outputs should include standard performance metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, PnL,
    etc.).
    ---
    #### **4. Order Management System (OMS)**
    The critical link between the internal system and external brokers/exchanges.
    *   **Broker Integration:**
        *   Implement broker-agnostic interfaces. The system should support connecting to multiple brokers, often
    via REST/WebSocket APIs or the FIX protocol.
        *   All sensitive credentials (API keys) must be stored securely using a secrets management system (e.g.,
    HashiCorp Vault).
    *   **Order Lifecycle Management:**
        *   The OMS must track the full lifecycle of every order: `PENDING` -> `SENT` -> `ACKNOWLEDGED` ->
    `PARTIALLY_FILLED` -> `FILLED` / `CANCELED` / `REJECTED`.
        *   It must consume execution reports from the broker and update the Portfolio Service in real-time.
    *   **Resilience:**
        *   The OMS must handle connection drops and broker downtime gracefully, with automated reconnection logic
     and order status reconciliation upon recovery.
    ---
    #### **5. Risk Management**
    This is a non-negotiable component to protect capital and ensure system stability. All orders must pass
    through the Risk Management Service before being sent to the OMS.
    *   **Pre-Trade Risk Checks (Synchronous):**
        *   **Position Sizing:** Check if the order size exceeds a predefined percentage of the portfolio.
        *   **Concentration Limit:** Prevent excessive capital allocation to a single asset or sector.
        *   **Buying Power:** Verify sufficient cash or margin is available.
        *   **Sanity Checks:** Block orders with nonsensical prices or quantities.
        *   **Blocklist:** Check against a list of non-tradable symbols.
    *   **Post-Trade Risk Monitoring (Asynchronous):**
        *   **Max Drawdown:** Monitor portfolio-level drawdown in real-time and trigger alerts or a system halt if
     a threshold is breached.
        *   **VaR (Value at Risk):** Calculate and monitor VaR to quantify potential losses.
    *   **Kill Switch:**
        *   A critical feature allowing for the immediate cancellation of all open orders and/or liquidation of
    all positions, which can be triggered manually or automatically by a severe risk breach.
    ---
    #### **6. Compliance & Logging**
    The system must maintain a complete and immutable audit trail of all activities.
    *   **Structured Logging:** All services must generate structured logs (e.g., JSON format).
    *   **Centralized Log Management:** Logs from all services must be aggregated into a central system (e.g., ELK
     Stack, Datadog) for analysis and auditing.
    *   **Audit Trail:** The system must log:
        *   Every signal generated by a strategy.
        *   Every risk check performed (pass or fail).
        *   Every order sent to the OMS and its subsequent lifecycle updates.
        *   Every execution report received from the broker.
    *   **Compliance Rules Engine:** A module to check trades against regulatory rules (e.g., wash sale rule)
    where applicable.
    ---
    #### **7. Performance & Monitoring**
    Continuous monitoring is essential for both technical and financial performance.
    *   **System Health Monitoring:**
        *   Track CPU, memory, and network usage for all services.
        *   Monitor message queue depth and database performance.
        *   **Key Metric:** End-to-end latency (from market data receipt to order placement).
    *   **Financial Performance Monitoring:**
        *   A real-time dashboard displaying portfolio PnL, position values, and key performance indicators for
    each strategy.
    *   **Alerting:**
        *   Configure automated alerts (via Slack, PagerDuty, email) for:
            *   System failures (service crashes, connectivity loss).
            *   Risk limit breaches.
            *   Large, unexpected PnL swings.
            *   Failed order submissions.
